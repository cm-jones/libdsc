libdsc for Debian
----------------

This package provides a high-performance data structures library for C programs.

Package Structure
---------------
The package is split into several components:
- libdsc0: Runtime library
- libdsc-dev: Development files and headers
- libdsc-dbg: Debug symbols
- libdsc-doc: Documentation and examples

Build Configuration
-----------------
The package is built with hardening flags enabled and includes:
- Position Independent Code (PIC)
- Stack protector
- Immediate binding
- Full RELRO
- Fortify source

The build system uses CMake with the following key options:
- RelWithDebInfo build type for optimal debugging experience
- Shared library build enabled
- RPATH disabled for compliance
- Tests enabled but non-blocking

Testing
-------
While tests are run during package building, failures won't block the build
process. This is to handle potential platform-specific timing issues in the
test suite. Test failures are logged and should be investigated.

Debug Symbols
------------
Debug symbols are separated into the libdsc-dbg package. Install this
package if you need to debug applications using libdsc or if you
encounter crashes.

Documentation
------------
Comprehensive documentation is available in the libdsc-doc package,
including API reference, examples, and implementation details.

Dependencies
-----------
The development package (libdsc-dev) pulls in all necessary build
dependencies for developing applications with libdsc.
